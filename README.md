Contains my vimrc and my Vim cheat sheet.

### Recommended resources on Vim
* D. Neil: [_Practical Vim_](https://pragprog.com/titles/dnvim2/practical-vim-second-edition/) (2nd edition) — Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2015
* A. Robbins, E. Hannah: [_Learning the vi & Vim Editors_](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-the-vi/9781492078791/) (8th edition) — O'Reilly, 2021
* [Vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org/)
* [Vim's offcial website](https://www.vim.org/about.php)

The first book is exceptionally good. The second one might be better suited as an introduction to Vim, although frankly I didn't like it that much when I read (an older edition of) it. The third resource is a great website that contains articles and short videos on various Vim features.
